# Term-Paper-E0-270
PyTorch implementation for the term paper I have submited for ML course.
 
 How to run:
 I have directly submitted the Python Notebook with all the code. To run, simply execute all the cells one by one.
 Since the model size was 418 MB, I could not upload the trained model. Hence training again would be necessary.
 Note that training would take only 10-15 minutes on BERT-CoLA as it is a small dataset.
 On BERT-snli, training will take 6 hours.
 BERT-SQuAD 1.1 is a pre fine tuned model so it is very easy to run and play with different questions and passages.
 Training the LSTM model would take 30 minutes but the training can be stopped after 5-6 iterations as the accuracy doesn't increase after this.
